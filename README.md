Report

## Markdown basics 

A report is a nonfiction document that organizes and summarizes facts on a specific topic, issue, or event, providing information for readers unfamiliar with the subject. Typically, a report includes an executive summary, introduction, body, and conclusion, often supplemented by a title page, table of contents, and references. There are various types of reports, such as academic reports (e.g., school or book reports) and business reports (e.g., annual reports or SWOT analyses), each serving to communicate ideas and insights effectively. Writing a report involves structured steps to ensure clarity and coherence.
